THERMOCALC is a thermodynamic calculation program (Powell & Holland 1988) that
uses an internally-consistent thermodynamic dataset (Holland & Powell, 1998, 2011)
to undertake thermobarometry and phase diagram calculations for metamorphic rocks.
However, using THERMOCALC to create a diagram is quite laborious; each curve
must be calculated by hand, and the Schreinemaker's analysis must
be done manually. The curves must be built up one by one, and manually combined.

**pypsbuilder** is developed with the idea to make this tedious process much easier
and more enjoyable while keeping the concept to force users understand the Phase
Rule, Schreinemaker's analysis, and how variance changes across field
boundaries.
