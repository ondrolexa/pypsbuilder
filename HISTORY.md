# Changes

### 2.2.2 (dev - XX YYY 2020)

 * gendrawpd fixed
 * fix to partially support TC347

### 2.2.1 (16 Jun 2020)

 * bugfix release
 * option to to move invpoint and keep results
   (useful to fine-tune topology)
 * tool to cleanup storage (trim metastable calculations)
 * option to hide labels of connected lines and points

## 2.2 (11 Apr 2020) - COVID-19 release

* pseudosection builders major update and refactoring
  - ptbuilder, txbuilder and pxbuilder implemented
  - compatible with TC 3.50
  - topology graph window added
  - dogmin implemented (results stored in projects)
  - autoconnect implemented
  - invariant point search implemented
  - merge of partially calculated univariant lines implemented
  - possibility to remove parts of univariant lines implemented
  - zoom to uni added to context menu
  - option to extend calculation range to extend univariant lines gently out of defined region
* psexplorers updated
  - PTPS, TXPS and PXPS implemented
  - possibility to merge several parts of pseudosection. Invariant points and
    univariant lines must be unique in single project.
  - calc along PT path implemented (now only for PT sections)

### 2.1.5 (25 Mar 2019)

* autocorrection of liquid model named as liq but starting guesses using L removed.
  User must check if liq model is coded properly. In case of tc-6xmn.txt it should be:

```
  % =================================================
  liq 8  1

     q(liq)          0.1814
     fsp(liq)        0.3490
     na(liq)         0.5840
     an(liq)        0.01104
     ol(liq)        0.01373
     x(liq)          0.7333
     h2o(liq)        0.4276

  % --------------------------------------------------
```

* silently ignore critical possible topology errors

### 2.1.2 (03 Apr 2017)

* Option to show bulk composition on psexplorer figures
