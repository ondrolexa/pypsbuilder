### Fixed
- gendrawpd fixed
- fix to partially support TC347

## [2.2.1] - 2020-06-16
### Added
- bugfix release
- option to to move invpoint and keep results
(useful to fine-tune topology)
- tool to cleanup storage (trim metastable calculations)
- option to hide labels of connected lines and points

## [2.2.0] - 2020-04-11
### Added

### Removed
- autocorrection of liquid model named as liq but starting guesses using L removed.
User must check if liq model is coded properly. In case of tc-6xmn.txt it should be:

```
  % =================================================
  liq 8  1

     q(liq)          0.1814
     fsp(liq)        0.3490
     na(liq)         0.5840
     an(liq)        0.01104
     ol(liq)        0.01373
     x(liq)          0.7333
     h2o(liq)        0.4276

  % --------------------------------------------------
```
